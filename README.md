# SELF-SORTING-DUSTBIN
# Summary of the project: 
Many times, we have seen people throw garbage without caring if its biodegradable or non-biodegradable and are unaware about the importance of segregating the waste. We built this Smart Dustbin with the idea of creating a method of easy segregation of waste along with touch free disposal for the users. Using a variety of sensors, we have been able to accomplish the segregation of wet waste and dry waste and the touch free feature, which is really important to prevent the transmission of germs, viruses and bacteria, and hence to prevent transmission of various diseases.
 	 
# Details about the project: 
# Features Planned
1.	 Our initial plan was to make a smart dustbin with some interesting added features like sorting of waste materials into moist and dry and biodegradable or non-biodegradable.
2.	Also, making it touch free, that is the user will only have to stand in front of it. 
3.	It is an initiative to create cleaner and much hygienic surroundings.

# Features Implemented
1.	If the user stands at a distance x from the dustbin (x set by the creator), the lid opens automatically as sensed by the ultrasonic sensor.
2.	At this moment, the user can throw the waste in the dustbin.
3.	The waste product through the mouth of the dustbin goes through a chamber where it is distinguished between biodegradable or non-biodegradable.
4.	According to the composition and moisture content of the waste the secondary lids open and the waste material is dropped there.
5.	In case of a biodegradable chamber, it is monitored by an air quality sensor which monitors the air quality in it and if the quality starts to get poor which basically shows decaying it will lead to the switching ON of the indicator LEDs. 
# STRENGTHS	
Helps in waste management.
Easy sorting of waste between the bio and non-biodegradable.
Instead of installing two bins for two separate waste this single bin can do both things.
Comes up with an indicator which observes the condition of biodegradable waste and informs when it is mandatory to be removed.
Prevents the foul odour from the waste from coming out to the surroundings.
Contributes to Swachh Bharat Abhiyan
# WEAKNESSES	
Depending on the place where it is installed the power supply must be decided. In the case of outdoor, solar will work but in case of indoor batteries must be installed which can have periodic maintenance. 
Proper and periodic maintenance of the machine will be required to keep a check on all the electronic parts, which might be difficult to do on a large level.
# OPPORTUNITIES	
If implemented properly, it will be a great step towards making our campus and country smart.
Can reduce the possibility of transfer of bacteria and germs and hence, reduce the transmission of diseases.
# THREATS	
It might be difficult to implement the project on a very large scale with limited number of requirements.
We may face external barriers while trying to implement it on a national level.









 
# Scope of Improvement: 
•	We can add more improvements in the segregation of waste part by increasing the categories in which the waste is divided into.
•	We can also add other features like automatic metal arms which will sense the waste around the dustbin and hence, clean it automatically.
•	We also must figure out the power supply for the dustbins as batteries require regular maintenance which might be a big hassle.
